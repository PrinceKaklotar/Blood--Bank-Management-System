Blood Connect
Blood Connect is a project where a blood donor can register themselves for blood donation by providing personal information such as:
Name
Age
Blood group
Mobile number
Pin code
City

All user information is stored in a CSV file.
When a person needs blood, they can input the required blood group and the pin code of their area. The program then:
Finds donors with the same blood group in that area.
Also finds donors with compatible blood groups that can receive the required blood.
Lists out all the persons who live in that area, so the needy person can directly contact them.
